-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- #1 How many orders were placed in January?

-- #2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)

-- #3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
